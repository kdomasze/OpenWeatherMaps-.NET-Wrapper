# OpenWeatherMaps-.NET-Wrapper

A .NET wrapper for [OpenWetherMaps](https://openweathermap.org/).

## What Does This API Cover?

Currently only the [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) for a single city is available.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

The project was created using Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.3.4.

### Instructions for Building

Pull the project and open the solution in Visual Studio. It should be ready for compilation out of the box.

### Instructions for Testing

The only requirement before testing is to copy `APIKey.default.txt` to `APIKey.txt` and enter your private API key from [OpenWeatherMaps](https://openweathermap.org/api) in as the first and only line. Once completed, all tests should run properly.
